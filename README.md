# Euler-a-day
This repo is to store my progress through the projecteuler.net questions.
Solutions as of 8/3/21 are written in Python since it's easy to work with. 

# Goals
1. Complete one problem every day and commit to Github.
2. Complete the first 50 Euler questions.

# Requirements
Programs should be able to produce a the correct solution in under 60 seconds.

# Outside sources?
Researching these problems on the internet/textbooks is allowed, however it should be research on the theory or looking for formulas, not for the code solution, or numerical solutions.

# Notes
For problems that require a bit more thinking on my end, I've included handwritten notes in each question to show my line of thinking.

# Can I use your solution for my own Project Euler questions?
Do try your best to find the solution without looking at other codebases. If you just want the numerical solutions, there are other repos for that.
